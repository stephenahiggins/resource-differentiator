Since then it can be said to have gone on to tackle many other issues including some associated with globalisation such as dilution of place identity and loss of community and economy. One of the founders, Rob Hopkins, says â€˜Itâ€™s about what you can create with the help of the people who live in your street, reimagining and rebuilding your neighbourhood, your town. If enough people do it, it can lead to real impact, to real jobs and real transformation of the places we live, and beyond.â€™ There are now over 1,200 Transition initiatives worldwide and increasing numbers of places are embracing a life where communities come together to share skills, grow food, provide care for dependents and fight inequality."""
